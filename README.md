# Voxalytics

A collection of Jupyter notebooks and supporting code to analyze all kinds of aspects around [Cryptovoxels](https://www.cryptovoxels.com/).

## Table of contents

* [Names](names.ipynb) – some stats around parcel names, token counting mostly.
* [Owners](owners.ipynb) – various stats around owners, collaborators, ownership in general and "parcel whales".
* [Heights, Areas, Volumes](heights_volumes.ipynb) – various stats around the distribution of heights, areas, and volumes of parcels.

*Note* that Github oftentimes doesn't render the text output in the files, so it might be best to use NBViewer, like so:

* [Names](https://nbviewer.org/github/ymyke/voxalytics/blob/main/names.ipynb)
* [Owners](https://nbviewer.org/github/ymyke/voxalytics/blob/main/owners.ipynb)
* [Heughts, Areas, Volumes](https://github.com/ymyke/voxalytics/blob/main/heights_volumes.ipynb)

## How to use

* Open the different notebooks (the files ending in `.ipynb`) and check out the analyses in there. Or simply click on the links in the table of contents.
* You can also checkout the repository and re-run the notebooks locally.
* To review changes between revisions of the Jupyter notebooks, ReviewNB is better suited than Github: https://app.reviewnb.com/ymyke/voxalytics/ (Can also be used to discuss individual sections in a notebook.)

## How to contribute

* Discuss existing stats by opening new or adding to existing [Issues](https://github.com/ymyke/voxalytics/issues) (label as `stats discussion`)
* Add more ideas as to what would be interesting questions to explore as new [Issues](https://github.com/ymyke/voxalytics/issues) (label as `new stats idea`).
* Help resolve [new stats ideas](https://github.com/ymyke/voxalytics/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22new+stats+idea%22) either by commenting on possible ways to resolve or by suggesting new code (via pull request or a comment in the issues).
