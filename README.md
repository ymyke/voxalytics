Ideas:
- height/area/volume per island?
- something with the name?
- owner:
    - certain owners dominant on certain islands? -> Islands per owner
    - And vice versa: Owners per island -> are there "monopolies"?
    - Are some owners specialized on certain geometries?
      - Get list of top x owners
      - select only those from df
      - boxplot with owner as x

Questions:
- labels?
- what is geometry?
